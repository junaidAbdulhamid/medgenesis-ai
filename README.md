## Empowering Underserved Hospitals with AI-Driven Healthcare Infrastructure

MedGenesis AI is an open-source initiative that brings advanced, accessible, and offline-compatible artificial intelligence tools to underfunded hospitals and clinics around the world. We’re building a suite of machine learning–powered systems to support triage, resource forecasting, diagnosis, and medical equipment management—designed specifically for low-resource, high-need environments.

---

## 🚑 Core Mission

To reduce preventable deaths and diagnostic delays in underserved regions by equipping healthcare workers with intelligent, real-time support systems—even in the absence of stable internet, sufficient staff, or expensive equipment.

---

## 💡 Current Modules

### 1. **AI Triage Assistant (In Progress)**
Classifies patient urgency levels based on symptoms, age, and vitals. Helps healthcare staff prioritize treatment when doctors are unavailable.

### 2. **Equipment Failure Predictor (Coming Soon)**
Forecasts breakdown risks of ventilators, ECGs, and other life-critical machines using time-series analysis.

### 3. **Resource Forecaster**
Predicts shortages in oxygen, beds, and staff using hospital usage patterns and ML-based demand forecasting.

### 4. **Offline Symptom-to-Diagnosis Tool**
Text-based assistant that maps patient symptoms to likely conditions using open-source medical knowledge and probabilistic models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** / **Scikit-learn** / **XGBoost**
- **Streamlit** (for front-end dashboard)
- **PostgreSQL + MIMIC-III** (for real-world medical data)
- **Google Colab** (model development)
- **GitHub** (version control & open source)

---

## 🌍 Social Impact

- Designed for **underfunded hospitals, rural clinics**, and **mobile health units**
- Enables non-physician healthcare workers to make better decisions
- Can be operated **offline** or on **low-end devices**
